This daiginjo-grade sake in the junmai style makes use of a 40% grain polish and lengthy fermentation at a low temperature to give it a velvet-smooth mouthfeel from beginning to end. A scent of strawberries and vanilla gives way to charming and voluptuous savory notes.  This label was adopted as the Sake of toast in the dinner meeting between President Putin and Prime Minister Abe in Japan 2016.  Putin was so plesantly surprised at the taste and asked the name of sake from the staff.  This sake was named to express the first brewer’s love for his late wife.",

Being the oldest and most primitive rice strain grown in Japan, Omachi presents a technical challenge that all sake brewers wish to face at least – and, owing to the difficulty, perhaps only – once in their career.

Toyobijin has charmed and fascinated fans both within Japan and across the globe, attracting still more attention through the practice of cultivating specific varieties of sake rice under contract with local farms – notably Yamada Nishiki, Sakemirai, Aiyama, Omachi, and Kameji. In a cruel twist of fate, torrential rainfall in July of 2013 resulted in the brewery suffering catastrophic damage, after being engulfed in a landslide consisting of a two-meter-high wall of gravel. Garnering support from the length and breadth of Japan allowed them to carry out a miraculous recovery operation, but the road back to full production has been a slow one. Nevertheless, they continue to pursue a passion for brewing captivating sake."

Mountain rice utilizes cold, run-off water from the mountain and receives less sunlight.  In contrast, rice grown in the plains has more sunlight, and water comes from ponds and rivers.  The differences in these conditions result in different characteristics in the rice, which is why you can’t simply group rice by strain.  Miyoshino has farm-direct contracts with each farmer to understand the rice and how it is grown, so the toji can apply the best brewing techniques to each type of rice.  This application of techniques goes for the rice polishing, where the toji chooses polishing rate by rice field, not by variety, to finding the right moto technique to bring out the best expressions of the rice."

The use of natural yeasts and bacteria is just a further extension of the “terrior” concept that uses local rice and the natural environment in a harmonious way to produce a sake the represents the essence of the Kii Peninsula."

      "content": "Itakura Shuzo is located in Shimane Prefecture’s Izumo City, a spiritual heartland celebrated throughout Japanese mythology, but more importantly, one of the birthplaces of sake. Legend has it that every October, Japan’s gods gather at Izumo’s Saka Shrine to brew sake which is followed by a massive party. The brewery goes to great lengths to impart some of this mythology into their brewing formula. They use Saka Nishiki rice, which takes its name from the shrine and is grown exclusively in Shimane Prefecture and source their water from the nearby Kitayama mountain range, another spiritual power spot. As you would expect of a brewery with an inextricable connection to the gods, their sake exudes divinity and clarity with depth of flavor in every sip."

While his first season as toji was in the year 2000 at the tender age of just 30, he had worked at the brewery before under the prolific toji, Nagasaki Yoshiji, a major driving force behind the development of the region’s ginjo production. Kojima left to continue honing his ginjo technique, but thanks to a recommendation from one of the senior brewing staff, was recruited back when his predecessor retired."

It is the answer he found when he researched the origins of people’s love for the beverage. While it is said that people originally brewed Gozenshu to show their gratitude to the gods for blessing them with nature, it was not just for that purpose. It was also thought that when you drunk Gozenshu you consumed natural energy which purified your body and gave you the power to find peace within yourself. The brand Tenon is named after the Buddhist sutra Mukyu Tenon which teaches that peace in heaven is peace on earth. Both these brands are a reflection of sake’s true essence and the profound spirit at the heart of Kojima’s innovative brewing philosophy."

Tanabe Sake Brewery’s home of Fukui Prefecture is famed as a snowy tundra, particularly in the north where winter can be particularly harsh. However it is this cold climate and the crystal-clear waters of the nearby Kuzuryu River that provide the perfect conditions for ginjo brewing; slow ferments at cold temperatures, to produce the brewery’s signature dignified exquisite flavor-profile inspired by the picturesque scenery of daffodils that even in extreme cold, bloom along the region’s famed Echizen Cape after which the brand is named. The brewery embodies this same uncompromising spirit in their brewing. Polishing their rice to as low as 56%, Tanabe Sake Brewery are quickly establishing themselves as the region’s gold standard in ginjo brewing."

It is one of a few “pure” sake rice strains.  It is very difficult to work with as it is prone to cracking during the milling process.  Despite the challenge, it produces wonderfully unique flavors that are deep, earthly, and have richer umami characteristics.  Hayakawa has been working with Omachi rice for 15 years.
